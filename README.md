The General assets manager is the combination of all other sub modules as it is the main module that oversees all operations taken by each of the other asset managers
Other Submodules has restrictions and priviledges example Lecturer Asset Manager cannot see Department Asset Manager data but Department Asset manager can have access to the Offices Manager Data and that goes up the tree
